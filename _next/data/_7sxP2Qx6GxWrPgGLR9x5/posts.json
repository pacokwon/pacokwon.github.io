The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\n\n- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.\n- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\n","title":"Two Forms of Pre-rendering","date":"2020-01-01","tags":[]},{"id":"ssg-ssr","content":"\nWe recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\n\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n\n- Marketing pages\n- Blog posts\n- E-commerce product listings\n- Help and documentation\n\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\n\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\n\nIn that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.\n\n```javascript\n// this is a code block\nconst x = 3;\nconst y = 3;\n```\n","title":"When to Use Static Generation v.s.
